/* 
constructNote

Write a function called constructNote, which accepts two strings, a message and some letters. 
The function should return true if the message can be built with the letters that you are given; 
otherwise, it should return false.

Assume that there are only lowercase letters and no space or special characters in both the 
message and the letters.

Constraints:

Time Complexity: O(M + N) - If M is the length of message and N is the length of letters:
*/

function constructNote(message, letters) {
    
}



/* 
separatePositive
Write a function called separatePositive which accepts an array of non-zero integers. 
Separate the positive integers to the left and the negative integers to the right. 
The positive numbers and negative numbers need not be in sorted order. 
The problem should be done in place (in other words, do not build a copy of the input array).

Constraints:

Time Complexity: O(N)
*/

/* 
isSubsequence

Write a function called isSubsequence which takes in two strings and checks whether the 
characters in the first string form a subsequence of the characters in the second string. 
In other words, the function should check whether the characters in the first string appear 
somewhere in the second string, without their order changing.

Constraints:

Time Complexity - O(N + M)
*/

/* 
averagePair


Write a function called averagePair. Given a sorted array of integers and a target average, 
determine if there is a pair of values in the array where the average of the pair equals the 
target average. There may be more than one pair that matches the average target.

Constraints:

Time Complexity: O(N)
*/

/* 
twoArrayObject
Write a function called twoArrayObject which accepts two arrays of varying lengths.
The first array consists of keys and the second one consists of values. 
Your function should return an object created from the keys and values. 
If there are not enough values, the rest of keys should have a value of null. 
If there not enough keys, just ignore the rest of values.
*/


/* 
sameFrequency
Write a function called sameFrequency. Given two positive integers, 
find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.

Constraints
Time Complexity - O(N + M)
*/


/* 
countPairs

Given an array of integers, and a number, find the number of pairs of integers in the array 
whose sum is equal to the second parameter. You can assume that there will be no duplicate values 
in the array.

Assume that there are only lowercase letters and no space or special characters in both the 
message and the letters.

Constraints

Time Complexity - O(N * log(N))

or

Time Complexity - O(N)
